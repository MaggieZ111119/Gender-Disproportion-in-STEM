Despite progress in some areas, the gender imbalance is stark: women represent only 28.2% of the STEM workforce, a significant contrast to their 47.3% representation in non-STEM sectors. Even more concerning is the underrepresentation of women in leadership roles in STEM, with women holding just over 10% of these positions [@pal2024global], see[@tbl-women]. As technology and innovation continue to shape our future, closing this gender gap is crucial not only for fairness but also for creating a diverse and comprehensive landscape that better addresses global challenges.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-women\n#| tbl-cap: \"This bar plot highlights the gender disparity between women in STEM and non-STEM sectors.
